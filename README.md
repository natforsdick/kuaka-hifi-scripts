# PacBio HiFi genome assembly  - Kuaka Whenua Hou 

Scripts associated with genome assembly from PacBio HiFi data for Kuaka Whenua Hou | Whenua Hou diving petrel (*Pelecanoides whenuahouensis*).

This project is a collaboration between Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research, the Department of Conservation, and Genomics Aotearoa, and reports back to Whenua Hou Komiti and Kaitiaki Rōpū. 

Collaborators: Nat Forsdick, Johannes Fischer, Igor Debski, Thomas Buckley. 

The purpose of genome assembly is to use the resulting genome as a reference when estimating metrics of diversity and differentiation for conservation purposes.
